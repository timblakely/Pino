# Pino

Pino the robot. An ongoing project to build a quadrupedal robot from the ground
up. 

## Disclaimer: this will not currently work for you.

This repository is a continuously changing, seething mess, and will continue to
be so for the forseeable future. I've made essentially zero effort to make this
work for anyone other than my own development environment. You're welcome to
browse around the code, but please don't expect anything to actually work
without somewhat extensive removal of the various hard-coded paths, hacks, and
general terrible code health. If you're still reading this and are actually
interested in getting any of this to _maybe_ compile, let me know :)
